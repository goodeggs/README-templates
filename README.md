# README templates

This is a repository of template README files for use in your projects.

## Why write readmes?
- To make it easier for people on our teams to get started working on unfamiliar
  apps.
- So that we can respond to pages more effectively even if we haven't worked with
  that particular app before.
- So that we can understand our systems better -- writing acts as a forcing function
  to organize our thinking.

## Templates

- [application README.md](application-README.md)
- [module README.md](module-README.md)

## Resources

- [Write the docs](http://docs.writethedocs.org/writing/) Some great
  documentation on writing documentation
